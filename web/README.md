# NMDC pilot

An early prototype system for NMDC.

**Note:** This early proof of concept is for collecting feedback on query,
interaction, and visualization features for NMDC, not for any kind of real use. In particular,
there is no access to the full raw data files, there is no login or ingestion, and there are no
associated analytics. All data models and interfaces are subject to change.
